## **Features**

### ⚙️ **Dynamic Mixture of Experts**

- **Modular Architecture:** The system dynamically creates and manages a mixture of experts (specialized models) based on task requirements.
- **Expert Routing:** Tasks are routed to the most suitable expert or combination of experts, optimizing performance and efficiency.

### 🔗 **Knowledge Graph Integration**

- **Entity Relationship Management:** The system integrates a knowledge graph to manage relationships between entities, enabling more contextual and intelligent decision-making.
- **Scalable and Flexible:** The knowledge graph is continuously updated and refined, providing a rich source of contextual data for various tasks.

### 🧠 **Shared Memory Management**

- **Short-Term, Long-Term, and Shared Memory:** The system employs advanced memory management techniques, allowing it to store and recall information across sessions.
- **Collaboration Between Experts:** Multiple experts can access shared memory, enabling them to collaborate dynamically and enhance decision-making.

### 💡 **Prompt Optimization**

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The system is equipped with sophisticated NLU capabilities to accurately interpret user prompts.
- **Dynamic Prompt Refinement:** User prompts are automatically refined and optimized, ensuring the system receives the most precise instructions possible.

### 🔄 **Self-Reflection and Continuous Improvement**

- **Performance Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors its own performance, analyzing successes and failures.
- **Autonomous Learning:** Leveraging active learning and reinforcement learning techniques, the system adapts and improves autonomously over time.

### 📡 **Kafka-Driven Architecture**

- **Decoupled Services:** The system uses Apache Kafka to decouple components, allowing for scalable, modular, and independent services.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Kafka enables real-time data streaming, ensuring that the system responds promptly to new data and tasks.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is required to orchestrate the various services.
- **Python 3.10**: The project uses Python 3.10, so ensure it's installed and available in your environment.

### **Installation**

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lmm-upgrade.git
cd lmm-upgrade
```

**Setup Dockerfiles and Docker Compose:**

Run the setup scripts to create Dockerfiles and configure Docker Compose:

```bash
./setup_webcrawler_dockerfile.sh
./setup_knowledge_graph_consumer_dockerfile.sh
./setup_memory_consumer_dockerfile.sh
./setup_docker_compose.sh
```

**Build and Start the Services:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### 🚀 Running the System

The Intelligent Autonomous System (IAS) is designed to be run using Docker Compose. Once the services are up and running, the system will:

- Scrape Data using the web crawler.
- Process Data by routing tasks to the appropriate experts.
- Integrate Data into the knowledge graph and memory using Kafka consumers.

### 🔍 Monitoring Services

You can monitor the logs of each service to ensure they are running as expected:

```bash
docker-compose logs <service_name>
```

For example:

```bash
docker-compose logs webcrawler
docker-compose logs knowledge_graph_consumer
docker-compose logs memory_consumer
```
