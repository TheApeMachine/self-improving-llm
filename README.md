# Adaptive LLM System

## Overview

The Adaptive LLM System is an advanced, flexible, and self-improving language model interface designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks. It combines various state-of-the-art components to create a system that can adapt to user needs, learn from interactions, and optimize its performance over time.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Task Classification**: Automatically identifies the type of task required based on user input.

2. **Flexible Topic Extraction**: Utilizes advanced language models to extract topics from user input without relying on predefined categories.

3. **Prompt Optimization**: Refines and clarifies user inputs to improve overall system performance.

4. **Adaptive Response Generation**: Generates responses based on the specific task and context, leveraging past interactions when relevant.

5. **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves past interactions to inform future responses and build a knowledge base.

6. **Background Knowledge Acquisition**: Autonomously researches topics to expand its knowledge base.

7. **Model Evaluation and Improvement**: Continuously evaluates its performance and searches for better models for specific tasks.

8. **User Feedback Analysis**: Analyzes user feedback to improve response quality over time.

9. **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes asynchronous programming for efficient handling of multiple tasks.

## Goals

1. **Adaptability**: Create a system that can handle a wide variety of language tasks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Improve performance over time through user interactions and autonomous learning.

3. **Flexibility**: Avoid hard-coded constraints and allow the system to adapt to new domains and types of queries.

4. **Efficiency**: Optimize system performance to handle requests quickly and efficiently.

5. **Transparency**: Provide clear logging and feedback mechanisms to understand system decisions and performance.

6. **Scalability**: Design the system to be easily expandable with new features and capabilities.

7. **User-Centric**: Focus on providing helpful and relevant responses to users, with the ability to learn from user feedback.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/adaptive-llm-system.git
   cd adaptive-llm-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add necessary API keys and configurations (e.g., `HF_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token`)

4. Run the system:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

After starting the system, you can interact with it through the command line interface. Type your queries or commands, and the system will respond accordingly. You can provide feedback after each interaction to help the system improve.

## Components

- `adaptive_llm_system.py`: Main system class that integrates all components
- `bart_prompt_optimizer.py`: Optimizes user inputs
- `memory_system.py`: Handles storage and retrieval of past interactions
- `response_analyzer.py`: Analyzes user feedback
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the system
